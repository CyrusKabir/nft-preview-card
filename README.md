### What I learned
I learned a lot about some sass featrues like color functions and loops. 

also I learned a lot about webpack and best practices on webpack configurations. it was a new concept for me (module bundlers) and I learned a lot at first with this little fem challenge about webapck. also I used autoprefixer which it was new too.

### Useful resources
